| [The Eternal Frost 2](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2310175-ssp-smp-1-7-10-the-eternal-frost-2-core-of-ice) | 2.06b6 | | I started this mod on a simple idea that came to me when playing on a modded server, I wanted to create a mod like the nether. So I started modding this mod : the "Eternal Frost". This mod is a "dimension" mod, so it adds the ability to teleport to another dimension which is have called the "Eternal Frost" (Old name is the "Freezer"). In order to teleport there, nothing more simple, just craft "The flint and diamond" and create a normal nether portal but filled with ice obsidian instead of obsidian. Then use the flint and diamond to make the portal appear. In the Eternal Frost, you'll end up either underground or overworld in a beautiful world made of various blocks going from deeply frozen stone to freezing water that'll hurt you on touch. |
